  RestCommander collects parameters from URI query-string, HTTP headers and HTTP body and passes them to your script.  
  Your script can read them from environment variables or from its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams" target="_blank">stdin</a>.
  You can also define what parameters with what types your script wants inside its <i>.yml</i> file.
  For example this script accepts a key <i>my_parameter</i> which is a string and reverses its value. 
  You can see script source and its <i>.yml</i> file by running the following commands: 
  <pre>
  docker run --entrypoint=/bin/bat restcommander:tour scripts/tour/3.--passing-parameters
  docker run --entrypoint=/bin/bat restcommander:tour scripts/tour/3.--passing-parameters.yml
  </pre>
  <small>After running commands go to the next example from above menu.</small>
options:
  my_parameter:
